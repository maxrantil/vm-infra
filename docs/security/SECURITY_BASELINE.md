*Values to be populated after initial scan execution*

## Accepted Risks

### High-Level Risk Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Acceptable Risk Categories:**
- Cloud provider checks not applicable to local libvirt infrastructure
- Low-severity documentation/style issues with minimal security impact
- Development environment optimizations (latest packages vs pinned versions)
- False positives verified through manual code review

❌ **NEVER Accept Without Explicit Security Review:**
- HIGH or CRITICAL severity findings
- Authentication/authorization bypass vulnerabilities
- Credential exposure or hardcoded secrets
- Remote code execution vectors
- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities

### Detailed Risk Acceptance

#### Local VM Infrastructure

**Risk Category:** Cloud Provider Misconfigurations
**Severity:** INFORMATIONAL
**Justification:** Trivy and Checkov include extensive cloud provider checks (AWS, GCP, Azure) that are not applicable to local libvirt/KVM infrastructure.

**Accepted Findings:**
- Unencrypted cloud disk volumes (not using cloud storage)
- Cloud-specific network security group rules
- Cloud IAM policy violations

**Compensating Controls:**
- Host-level disk encryption (LUKS) available if needed
- Local network isolation (libvirt default network)
- SSH key-based authentication (password auth disabled)

**CVSS Impact:** N/A (not applicable findings)
**Review Date:** 2026-01-13

#### Development Environment Package Management

**Risk Category:** Package Version Pinning
**Severity:** LOW
**Justification:** Development VMs use latest stable packages from Ubuntu LTS repositories for up-to-date security patches. This is preferred over pinned versions that may miss critical updates.

**Tradeoff Analysis:**
- ✅ **Benefits:** Automatic security updates, latest features
- ⚠️ **Risks:** Reproducibility issues, potential breaking changes
- ✅ **Mitigation:** Ubuntu LTS stable repos (not edge PPAs), Ansible idempotency, test VMs before production use

**CVSS Impact:** 2.5 (Low supply chain risk from trusted Ubuntu repos)
**Review Date:** 2026-01-13

### Security Exceptions by Scanner

#### Trivy Exceptions

See `.trivyignore` for complete list with individual justifications.

**Summary:**
- **DS002:** Container root user checks (not applicable - VMs not containers)
- **AVD-GCP-0001, AVD-AWS-0001:** Cloud provider encryption (not using cloud)

#### Checkov Exceptions

See `.checkov.yml` for complete list with individual justifications.

**Summary:**
- **CKV_TF_1:** Missing Terraform output descriptions (low priority)
- **CKV2_GCP_1, CKV_GCP_38:** GCP-specific encryption checks (not using GCP)

#### ansible-lint Exceptions

**Summary:**
- **No exceptions currently accepted** - All findings to be remediated or documented after baseline scan

#### shellcheck Exceptions

**Summary:**
- **No exceptions currently accepted** - All findings to be remediated or documented after baseline scan

## Threat Model Context

### Attack Surface

**In Scope:**
- Local workstation compromise (attacker has local access)
- Compromised VM escaping to host
- Malicious dotfiles injection via GitHub
- Supply chain attacks on Terraform/Ansible dependencies
- Infrastructure misconfiguration vulnerabilities

**Out of Scope:**
- Remote internet-based attacks (VMs not internet-exposed)
- Cloud provider vulnerabilities (not using cloud infrastructure)
- Physical security (assumes secure physical environment)

### Security Controls

**Preventive Controls:**
- SSH key-based authentication only (no passwords)
- VM-specific deploy keys (no credential proliferation) - CVE-2024-ANSIBLE-001 fixed
- Input validation in provision-vm.sh (SEC-001 through SEC-007)
- Pre-commit hooks (secret detection, syntax validation)
- **Static security scanning (this initiative)** ← NEW

**Detective Controls:**
- Automated security scanning on every PR/push
- Weekly scheduled scans for new CVEs
- GitHub Security tab integration (SARIF)
- Ansible-lint production profile
- 72 behavior tests covering security features

**Corrective Controls:**
- Automated VM rollback on provisioning failure (SEC-007)
- Manual deploy key revocation per VM
- Terraform destroy for clean teardown

## Enforcement Strategy

### Phase 1: Baseline Establishment (Current)

**Duration:** Weeks 1-2 (2025-10-13 to 2025-10-27)
**Mode:** Soft-fail (report only, don't block PRs)
**Activities:**
1. Run initial scans on current codebase
2. Review all findings and categorize
3. Update `.trivyignore` and `.checkov.yml` as needed
4. Document accepted risks in this file
5. Team training on security scanning results

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All findings reviewed and categorized
- ✅ Exception files finalized with justifications
- ✅ Baseline documented and committed
- ✅ Team understands security scanning process

### Phase 2: Gradual Enforcement (Future)

**Start Date:** TBD (after Phase 1 complete, ~2025-10-28)
**Mode:** Hard-fail on HIGH/CRITICAL findings
**Changes:**
- `exit-code: '1'` for Trivy (block HIGH/CRITICAL)
- `soft_fail: false` for Checkov (block policy violations)
- Remove `|| true` from ansible-lint (block production profile violations)
- Remove `|| true` from shellcheck (block warnings)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Zero new HIGH/CRITICAL findings in PRs
- ✅ Security scanning runtime <90 seconds
- ✅ <5% false positive rate
- ✅ Team trained on remediation workflows

## Maintenance and Review

### Quarterly Review Process

**Schedule:** January 13, April 13, July 13, October 13

**Review Checklist:**
1. Re-run all security scans and compare to baseline
2. Review all accepted risks - are they still valid?
3. Check for new vulnerability types in scanner updates
4. Update CVSS scores based on current threat landscape
5. Remove obsolete exceptions
6. Update compensating controls
7. Document changes in git commit

### Trigger for Ad-Hoc Review

- New HIGH or CRITICAL finding in scheduled scan
- Major infrastructure changes (new providers, services)
- Security incident affecting similar infrastructure
- Scanner version updates with new checks
- Regulatory/compliance requirement changes

### Version History

## Integration with Existing Security

### Defense-in-Depth Layer Model

```
Layer 1: Pre-commit Hooks
    ↓ (Prevents obvious issues from being committed)
Layer 2: Static Security Scanning ← NEW (Issue #51)
    ↓ (Catches IaC misconfigurations in PRs)
Layer 3: Behavior Tests
    ↓ (Validates security features work correctly)
Layer 4: Runtime Validation (SEC-001 to SEC-007)
    ↓ (Prevents exploitation during provisioning)
Layer 5: VM-Specific Deploy Keys
    ↓ (Limits blast radius of compromise)
```

### Complementary Coverage Analysis

| Vulnerability Type | Static Scanning | Runtime Validation | Pre-commit Hooks | Behavior Tests |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Hardcoded secrets in IaC | ✅ Checkov | ❌ N/A | ✅ detect-private-key | ❌ N/A |
| Terraform misconfiguration | ✅ Trivy | ❌ Too late | ❌ N/A | ⚠️ Indirect |
| Malicious dotfiles path | ❌ Cannot predict | ✅ SEC-003 | ❌ N/A | ✅ Direct |
| Ansible anti-patterns | ✅ ansible-lint | ❌ N/A | ⚠️ YAML syntax | ⚠️ Indirect |
| Shell script issues | ✅ shellcheck | ❌ N/A | ✅ shellcheck | ⚠️ Indirect |
| SSH key permissions | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ SEC-005 | ⚠️ detect-key | ✅ Direct |
| install.sh malicious code | ❌ External repo | ✅ CVE-2 | ❌ N/A | ✅ Direct |

**Conclusion:** Static scanning adds critical preventive coverage for IaC-specific vulnerabilities that cannot be detected at runtime. No conflicts with existing security layers - all are complementary.

## Scan Performance Targets

**Expected Scan Times:**
- Trivy: 20-30 seconds (small codebase, ~500 lines IaC)
- Checkov: 15-25 seconds (minimal policy evaluation)
- ansible-lint: 10-15 seconds (single playbook)
- shellcheck: 5-10 seconds (2 main scripts + test scripts)
- **Total: 50-80 seconds** ✅ (well under 90 second target)

**Optimization Strategy:**
- ✅ Parallel job execution (all scanners run concurrently)
- ✅ Path filtering (only scan when IaC changes)
- ✅ Pip caching (reduce Python setup time)
- ✅ GitHub Actions caching (reduce dependency downloads)

**Performance SLA:** <90 seconds total workflow runtime
